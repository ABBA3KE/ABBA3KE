I’m a Junior Full-Stack Engineer passionate about building real-world projects from start to finish. Currently exploring Web3 development alongside my full-stack journey, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, functional, and user-friendly solutions.

I’m constantly learning, improving, and open to collaborating on meaningful projects.
